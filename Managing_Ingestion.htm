        <h1>Managing Ingestion</h1>
        <p>The rate of data creation is rarely constant. Whether your organization sees seasonal spikes, or if a new feature or product line produces huge increases in activity, Sumo Logic meets the needs of your organization, known or unknown, while maintaining the search performance you rely on.</p>
        <p>When designing your deployment, itâ€™s important to consider how logs will be ingested across Collectors in your account.</p>
        <h2>Ingestion management</h2>
        <p>Part of managing spikes in activity is properly slowing the rate of ingestion while the demand is at its peak, known as <b>throttling</b>.</p>
        <p>Throttling is enabled across all Collectors in an account. Sumo Logic measures the amount of data already committed to uploading against the number of previous requests and available resources (quota) in an account. Although the rate of uploads may be slowed, logs remaining on a Collector will be uploaded over an appropriate amount of time.</p>
        <p>Throttling also keeps one Collector from uploading more data than others--to the point where all data is being ingested from one Collector.</p>
        <h2>Account caps</h2>
        <p>Additionally, Sumo Logic imposes account caps on uploads to better protect against huge, unexpected overages in an account. By default, organizations are allowed to exceed between 2 times to 5 times the daily maximum (depending on account size). In general terms, this means that a paid 500GB account can spike up to 1.5TB. Again, even if the cap is exceeded, log data is kept safely at the Collector level until quota is made available, at which time the data is ingested.</p>
        <p>Sumo Logic free accounts can expect slight different behavior. If a Sumo Logic Free account regularly exceeds the cap, the account is temporarily disabled until quota becomes available (or until the account is upgraded).</p>
        <p>Sumo Logic accounts can be upgraded at any time to allow for additional quota.</p>
