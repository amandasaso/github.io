        <h1>How the Content Library works</h1>
        <p>The Content Library provides a single interface to organize and share searches and Dashboards. Folders make it easy to organize your content. By default, each user in an account has two folders: Saved and Shared. Content stored in the Saved folder is private until a user <a href="Publishing_Content.htm">publishes</a> a search or Dashboard. Content in the Shared folder is shared with all users across an organization’s account.</p>
        <p>Dashboards and searches are marked with icons to help you discern which content type you’re viewing. There are three ways to view the content (the Show options). Additionally you can view all content in a flat list by clicking the Display icon.</p>
        <p>You can launch a search or open a Dashboard by just clicking it.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p class="Indent">A. Click to view content in the Shared folder.<br />B. Click to view content in the Saved folder.<br />C. Click to create a new folder.<br />D. Search icon.<br />E. Dashboard icon.<br />F. Click to view folder contents.<br />G. Click to view searchs.<br />H. Click to view Dashboards.<br />I. Click to display all content in a flat view (not organized into folders).<br />J. Click to close the Content Library.</p>

        <h3>What's the difference between sharing and publishing?</h3>
        <p>Any search or Dashboard you add to your Shared folder is immediately made available to all users in your organization, exactly in the state the search or Dashboard in at the moment you shared it. A shared search is static--changes made to the search are not updated to other users. Shared content can be accessed by anyone in the organization. Think of shared content as being “pulled” by a user from a central repo.</p>
        <p>Published content is slightly different. Once you publish a search or Dashboard, a user can Subscribe to the content, meaning that as you make changes to it, those changes are reflected in the user’s content as well. Think of published content as being “pushed” to a user who subscribes; any changes are pushed (updated) to subscribers.</p>
        <p>Searches and Dashboards can be published and unpublished at any time.&#160;Additionally, other users can copy what you've published and make further customizations.</p>
