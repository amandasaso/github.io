        <h1>Using Role-Based Access Control with Sumo Logic</h1>
        <p>Sumo Logic now supports Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to allow Administrators to customize system access. With RBAC, Administrators <a href="Managing_Roles__Administrator_Topic_.htm">create roles</a> that are created for groups of users who perform various job functions. Users are not assigned permissions directly, but inherit permissions through roles (or even through a single role). Role assignments can <a href="Managing_Roles__Administrator_Topic_.htm">grant users permissions</a> to access some data sets, or can <a href="Managing_Roles__Administrator_Topic_.htm">restrict users</a> from accessing types of data. </p>
        <p>These benefits extend beyond IT&#160;or operations functions. For example, let's say we're designing a role for a sales team. The sales team needs a very targeted subset of data to see who is accessing a portal, giving them insights that they can use to go after leads or cultivate prospects. Or, for a completely different example, in a hospital setting, data related to patients' personal information uploaded from a specific Collector can be completely segregated from other data types, making sure that both security and patient confidentiality policies are met simultaneously. </p>
        <p>Administrators benefit from a more streamlined user management process with RBAC. Instead of creating permissions based on a user, and then having to repeat the process with every user, Admins can simply assign roles to a user's account. For example, an IT group can quickly be assigned a role that sets access and permissions that should be identical across the team. You'll <a href="Managing_Roles__Administrator_Topic_.htm">set up the role once</a>, then <a href="Managing_Roles__Administrator_Topic_.htm">assign it to each user</a> with just a few clicks. Roles can be created on a per-group basis, per-job function basis, and so on. </p>
        <p>RBAC can also help with site-specific data. Perhaps an Admin would like to assign roles to users geographically, where a group in one location is managed through one role, while a similar group at another site is assigned a different role--each group has access to site-specific data, allowing them the permissions they need to perform their duties, while preventing sensitive information from leaving a site.</p>
        <p>In addition to data access, user roles are also used to grant permissions to <span class="MyVariablesCollector">Collector</span>s, restricting access to <a href="Managing_Users.htm"><span class="MyVariablesCollector">Collector</span> management</a> (which refers to installing, upgrading, and monitoring <span class="MyVariablesCollector">Collector</span>s) to only the users who need that level of control over the operations of a <span class="MyVariablesCompanyName">Sumo Logic</span> account.</p>

        <h2>Managing Users and Roles</h2>
        <p>Tools used to manage users and roles are located in the <span class="MyVariablesCompanyName">Sumo Logic</span> <![CDATA[ ]]><span class="MyVariablesWeb Application">Web Application</span>. Two pages toggle between user  management options and role management options.</p>
        <p>All user creation and editing is available via the <b>Manage Users</b> page, while all role creation and editing is done through the <b>Manage Roles</b> page. To toggle between the pages you'll click the <b>View</b> buttons in the top right of each page:</p>
