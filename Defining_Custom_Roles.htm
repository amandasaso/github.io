        <h1>Defining custom roles</h1>
        <p>Roles are specified using search language constructs in a Query String. The string is added silently to every query run by a user assigned to a role. </p>
        <p>In addition, roles determine who has the ability to manage <span class="MyVariablesCollector">Collector</span>s in a <span class="MyVariablesCompanyName">Sumo Logic</span> account.</p>
        <p>When creating a new role, you'll need to specify the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Name.</b> Choose a name that concisely describes the role.</li>
            <li value="2"><b>Description.</b> An optional description of the role.</li>
            <li value="3"><b>Query String</b>. Determines the data users assigned to the role can access. For more information, see <a href="Construcing_a_Query_String.htm#Construc">Constructing a query string.</a></li>
            <li value="4"><b>Permissions.</b> Determines a role's ability to read or manage <span class="MyVariablesCollector">Collector</span>s. Roles that are set to only Read <span class="MyVariablesCollector">Collector</span>s can run searches, but cannot install or upgrade <span class="MyVariablesCollector">Collector</span>s; the Manage <span class="MyVariablesCollector">Collector</span>s option allows a user to install, upgrade, and otherwise manage all the <span class="MyVariablesCollector">Collector</span>s (and <span class="MyVariablesSource">Source</span>s) in a <span class="MyVariablesCompanyName">Sumo Logic</span> account.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How do roles work together?</h2>
        <p>When a user is assigned to more than one role, the rules are combined with an <code>OR</code> in front of each query the user runs. Users inherit the highest level of access granted in the roles they are assigned. For example, if a user is assigned to the role "admin" which has the most capabilities, and also to a role "advanced user" which a different set of capabilities, the user will have the capabilities of both roles.</p>
        <p>For example, let's say an IT team member is assigned to roles that, when combined, allows him to access to a Collector named firewall, yet no access to a Collector named HR. His combined query string (added to every search) would look like:</p>
        <p class="Indent"><code>_collector=firewall OR !_collector=hr AND [search query]</code> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <p>He's able to see IT-related errors and activity, but HR records remain out of his search results.</p>
        <p class="Tip">To restrict a user to a certain level you'll need to remove that user from the Administrator role and add him or her to a role with fewer permissions.</p>
        <h3>What about shared content?</h3>
        <p>The results of shared searches will be filtered by the role of the person who shared the search). For example, if a user assigned to roles that allow a higher level of access shares a Dashboard, users with lower levels of access will  see the same data--the Monitor is run against the user's permissions, and the resulting data displays.</p>
        <p>The same is true of shared searches. If a user with a low level of access shares a search, when a user with higher access permissions runs the query he or she will see a different set of results.</p>
